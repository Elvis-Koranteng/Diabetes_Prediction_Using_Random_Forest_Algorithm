# Diabetes Prediction Using Random Forest Algorithm

This project aims to develop a predictive model using the Random Forest algorithm to identify patients who may be at risk of developing diabetes based on their medical history and demographic information. The model is trained on a dataset that includes various features such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model is stored in the file `diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv`. It contains a collection of medical and demographic data from patients, along with their diabetes status. The dataset is preprocessed and formatted to be compatible with the Random Forest algorithm.

## Jupyter Notebook

The main component of this project is the Jupyter Notebook file `Diabetes_Prediction.ipynb`. This notebook provides a step-by-step implementation of the Random Forest algorithm to train the predictive model and perform diabetes predictions on new patient data. The notebook includes code, explanations, and visualizations to guide you through the process.

To run the notebook, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open the Jupyter Notebook in your preferred Python environment and execute each cell sequentially to train the model, evaluate its performance, and predict diabetes in new patients based on their medical history and demographic information.

## Results

The trained Random Forest model achieves a certain level of accuracy in predicting diabetes status based on the provided dataset. However, it is important to note that the accuracy obtained from the provided dataset may not reflect the model's performance on unseen data or real-world scenarios. Further evaluation, cross-validation, and external validation are recommended to assess the model's reliability and generalizability.

## Future Improvements

This project serves as a starting point for diabetes prediction using the Random Forest algorithm. To enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of the model, you can consider the following improvements:

- Explore additional feature engineering techniques to extract more meaningful information from the dataset.
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to optimize the performance of the Random Forest model.
- Consider using ensemble methods or other classification algorithms for comparison and potential improvement.
- Collect more diverse and representative data to enhance the model's generalizability and reduce biases.
